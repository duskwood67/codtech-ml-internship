# Task 3 - Image Classification using CNN

This notebook builds and trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using TensorFlow to classify images from the **Fashion MNIST** dataset.

## 📌 Dataset:
- Fashion MNIST (60,000 training and 10,000 test images of clothing items)
- Classes: T-shirt, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot

## ✅ Steps Covered:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- CNN model creation with Conv2D and MaxPooling layers
- Model training and validation
- Accuracy evaluation and visualization

## 🛠️ Libraries Used:
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## 💡 Note:
Model achieves ~90% accuracy. More layers or epochs can improve it further.
