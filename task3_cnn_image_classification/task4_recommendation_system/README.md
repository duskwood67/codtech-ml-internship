# Task 4 - Recommendation System using SVD

This notebook builds a basic **Recommendation System** using **Matrix Factorization (SVD)** from the `scikit-surprise` library.

## ✅ Features:
- Predicts ratings a user would give to items they haven't rated yet
- Recommends items based on collaborative filtering
- Evaluates model performance using RMSE

## 📁 Dataset:
- Sample ratings by 5 users across 5 items (custom dataset)

## 🔧 Libraries:
- pandas
- scikit-surprise

## 📌 Techniques Used:
- Matrix Factorization (SVD)
- Evaluation using RMSE
- Top-N Recommendations

## 💡 Note:
For real-world use, replace the custom dataset with MovieLens, Amazon, or Flipkart product ratings.
